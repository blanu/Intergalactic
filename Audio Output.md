As audio outpus are already at line out voltage, there is no need for a special audio output converter module. As there are a number of audio signal connector formats, the standard methods can be used to connect a module to these:

- 1/4" audio cable - use a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter
- Eurorack - there are a number of line out / Eurorack converters such as the Intellijel Line In 1U module to connect your Eurorack rig to your Intergalactic deck.

Of course, audio converter modules are still possible which convert from these formats into line out voltage, if it is desirable to have all of one's audio gear inside the deck.
