As audio inputs are already at line in voltage, there is no need for a special audio input converter module. As there are a number of audio signal connector formats, the standard methods can be used to connect these to a module:

- 1/4" audio cable - use a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter
- XLR microphone - use an audio interface with a preamp
- High impendance guitar input - use an audio interface with a high-impedance 1/4" input
- Eurorack - there are a number of line in / Eurorack converters such as the Intellijel Line Out 1U module to connect your Eurorack rig to your Intergalactic deck.

Of course, audio converter modules are still possible which convert from all of these formats into line in voltage, if it is desirable to have all of one's audio gear inside the deck.
